## Purpose

An organized place to put all my programming language design projects. I am making an attempt to keep the
projects here well-documented and tested. Some of them directly related to programming language design (like my 
java type system implementation), and others are just libraries that I want to keep well documented (like my injection library,
which utilizes the type system implementation).

## Projects

- [JavaType](javatype/landing.md) - Java type system implementation
- [Fill](fill/landing.md) - Simple java injection library
